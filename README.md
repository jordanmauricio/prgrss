#PRGRSS

PRGRSS is a working prototype of a major feature of a small startup that I had worked on. The prototype runs on the Meteor framework and its purpose is to work as a scraper. After a user logs in, they will be presented with certain links to various websites previously submitted by other users. They are also presented with a input field where they can paste an URL of an article or similar, and the application would fetch relevant information (photo, title etc.) and post it on the homepage. Comment sections are added to every new link posted with every user being able to comment, reply to other comments, and manage their own comments. 

The video below showcases the final prototype that was presented, but the code here only applies to the small final section where the demo user adds a link and comments on it. The reason for this, and not the final prototype, is that the final prototype had a lot of extra bits of navigation and routing in order to replicate what the final flow of the application would have been. This meant a lot of extra files, but this version can be shown upon request.
